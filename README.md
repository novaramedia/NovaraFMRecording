# NovaraFMRecording

Run .py file in commandline / anaconda with args "record novarafm [x num of minutes]"

Filepath variable "settingspath" is currently hardcoded into NovaraFM-record.py, will need to sort out once filestorage etc is figured out.

settings.ini file can be updated with other stations if necessary. NovaraFM-record.py currently points to this as being in same folder as settingspath, which may also need changing later down the line.
